# Welcome to our GitHub page!

<b>Greetings, cybernaut!</b>

Before you check out our selected repositories for yourself, we'd like to introduce ourselves properly so you can get to know us better. <b>Let's get started!</b>

We are a small group of creatives based in ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½MexicoðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ who seek to express ourselves through different disciplines, always looking to maintain a balance between creative desire and social responsibility to our community.

Disciplines that we are currently using as creative tools are varied, ranging from fashion design, web design, programming and finally the study and application of computer science in creative environments.


In <span style="color: #5FD1AC;"><b>avosquad</b></span> we do not believe in internal hierarchies, so each and every one of us has the same authority to make relevant decisions in the projects we have.

Although we do not have a scheme of authorities, we believe that it is important to take into account the word of those whose experience in a specific subject is remarkable. 

That is why we can share with you each of our members and their main skill sets. Take a moment to get to know us, maybe you can identify with one of us:
